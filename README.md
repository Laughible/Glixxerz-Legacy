# Glixxerz-Legacy
The original Glixxerz got slapped into the shadow realm, with no word from them whatsoever. The twitter is inactive, and the original project is lost, but I still have one of the javascripts in a google doc. And now, I am ready to release it into the public eye.
In the future, I plan to recover more of the lost javascripts. But, this is just the beginning.
Thank you Glixxerz, you were such a lengend.
